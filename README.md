Fancey cell homework i chose to do B so i needed to make basic date functions.

run the two difference files with d8. differenceBuild gives you a number in days that shows the difference between build dates of tanks. differenceWW2 shows how many days there is between when a tank was built and the start of WW2.

I am doing the second problem in chapter 9. However if you are going to force me to change i will do the 1st one.
